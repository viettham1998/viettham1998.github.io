  author={Le, Hoang-Minh and Nguyen, Gia-Huy and Huynh, Viet-Tham and Le, Minh-Kha and Tran, Minh-Triet and Nguyen, Tam V and Tran, Thanh Ngoc-Dat},
  abstract={In developing countries, high schoolers rarely have opportunities to conduct chemical experiments due to the lack of facilities. There-fore, chemistry experiment simulation is an alternative environment for students to do the chemistry lab assignments. Despite the need of creating virtual simulations to expand the application usability, it is challenging to synthesize a realistic environment given the limited computing resources. In this paper, we propose Chemisim, a highly realistic web-based VR laboratory simulation for students with high quality and usability. In particular, we make use of the fluid simulation system to mimic real chemical reactions. The imple-mented simulation was based on the chemistry assignments in the national education system, consulted by chemical teachers. Then we deployed the simulator on the web to promote a wide range of students usage. The system was evaluated by collecting and analyzing feedback from chemical teachers based on four criteria, namely, convenience, realism, functionality, and preferences. Our experimental findings address educational challenges and produce innovative technical solutions to solve them in developing countries.},

  title={MobileNet-SA: Lightweight CNN with Self Attention for Sketch Classification},
  author={Huynh, Viet-Tham and Nguyen, Trong-Thuan and Nguyen, Tam V and Tran, Minh-Triet},
  abstract={Sketch classification plays a crucial role across diverse domains, including image retrieval, artistic style analysis, and content-based image retrieval. While CNNs have demonstrated remarkable success in various image-related tasks, the computational complexity of large models poses challenges in resource-constrained environments. To address this concern, we propose MobileNet-SA, a novel lightweight model that seamlessly integrates a self-attention module into the MobileNet architecture, with a specific focus on enhancing sketch classification performance. The MobileNet-SA model leverages the inherent efficiency of lightweight CNN while harnessing the power of self-attention mechanisms to effectively capture spatial dependencies and enrich feature representations within sketch data. In our experiments, MobileNet-SA achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating an impressive accuracy of 93.5% on the challenging SketchyCOCO dataset and 96.7% on the GM-Sketch dataset. We thoroughly evaluate the model’s performance across diverse sketch classes, confirming its robustness and generalization capabilities, which make it well-suited for real-world applications where input sketches may exhibit significant variations. Our research indicates that MobileNet-SA not only outperforms existing methods but also offers an efficient and interpretable solution for sketch classification tasks.},

  author={Huynh, Viet-Tham and Nguyen, Tam V and Tran, Minh-Triet},
  abstract={Sketching indoor scenes is helpful in daily activities as it allows for quick visualization and planning of room layouts, furniture arrangements, design ideas, or scene creation for games and entertainment. This motivates our proposal of Sketch2Reality, a system to simplify the creation of immersive 3D indoor scenes from 2D sketch images. Users sketch their desired scene, and our system identifies sketched objects and their positions, then retrieves and populates corresponding 3D models into the generating 3D scene. Users can then modify the scene, rearrange furniture, adjust lighting, and add or remove objects. Integration with Virtual Reality technology allows users to experience and interact with the scene realistically. Our experiments with three groups of users with different experience levels in 3D scene design and creation demonstrate the efficiency and usefulness of our solution. Sketch2Reality empowers users to dynamically bring their ideas to life, combining sketching, AI assistance for 3D generation, and VR for enhanced creativity and design exploration.},

In particular, we make use of the city camera system for traffic analysis. It seeks to recognize the traffic vehicles and traffic flows, with reduced intervention from monitoring staff. Then, we develop a city traffic planning simulator upon the analyzed traffic data. The simulator is used to support metropolitan transportation planning.

  abstract={Recognizing hand-drawn sketches is a promising starting point for various applications, such as assisting artists in creating 3D environments for games or virtual environment scenes quickly and efficiently from concept arts. In addition, by understanding drawings, we can generate 3D models that can be used for further design and development. Thus, in this paper, we aim to develop a novel lightweight network that can accurately recognize sketch drawings. We propose a lightweight-yet-efficient neural network based on MobileNetV2 for sketch recognition and employ knowledge distillation to train the proposed model from EfficientNet-B4. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method, we collect a dataset of sketches comprising 1800 drawings in 12 categories, ranging from furniture to animals. The experimental results show that our network model achieves an accuracy of 96.7%, with 96.9% precision, 96.7% recall, and 96.7% F1-score. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach has great potential for practical sketch recognition applications, such as interior design or VR scene generation.},

  title={Leveraging Deep Learning and Knowledge Distillation for Enhanced Traffic Anomaly Detection in Transportation Systems},
  author={Tran,Mai-Khiem and Huynh,Viet-Tham and Tran,Minh-Triet},
  abstract={This paper introduces an innovative approach to enhance traffic anomaly detection in transportation systems using deep learning and knowledge distillation. We create a robust dataset from 427 videos containing 1,415 accident-related events, spanning various anomalies like accidents, car crashes, and pedestrian violations. To address real-time anomaly detection challenges, we propose a novel lightweight neural network architecture inspired by EfficientNet-B0, designed for efficient video anomaly detection. Through knowledge distillation, a student model learns from a teacher model’s predictions, resulting in heightened anomaly detection accuracy. Experimental results highlight the approach’s efficacy, with the knowledge-distilled student model consistently outperforming the standalone lightweight network, achieving an accuracy of 94.83% compared to 94.16%. This research offers a practical solution for real-time traffic anomaly detection, which is especially valuable in resource-constrained environments. Fusing a unique dataset, EfficientNet-B0-like structure, lightweight architecture, and knowledge distillation holds significant potential for fostering safer and more efficient transportation systems.},

  abstract={Semen analysis is crucial to determine men’s fertility; however, microscope-based manual spermatozoa evaluation is time-consuming and costly. Therefore, it has become essential to develop computeraided-semen-analysis systems. To facilitate automated spermatozoa analysis, we propose a simple yet efficient framework for tracking sperms and predicting their motility. Different from existing methods, our proposed framework centralizes a new paradigm, dubbed sperm having a tail. We develop a novel tail-aware sperm detection model to advance the detection ability of dense, tiny, and transparent sperm cells. Furthermore, to enhance sperm tracking, a scene change detection technique is utilized to suppress identity assignment errors of similar sperms, resulting in improved sperm motility measurement. Experimental results show that our framework works well with an insignificant trade-off in execution time, which is suitable for the real-time clinical setting requirement.},

  abstract={3D object retrieval is an important yet challenging task that has drawn more and more attention in recent years. While existing approaches have made strides in addressing this issue, they are often limited to restricted settings such as image and sketch queries, which are often unfriendly interactions for common users. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel SHREC challenge track focusing on text-based fine-grained retrieval of 3D animal models. Unlike previous SHREC challenge tracks, the proposed task is considerably more challenging, requiring participants to develop innovative approaches to tackle the problem of text-based retrieval. Despite the increased difficulty, we believe this task can potentially drive useful applications in practice and facilitate more intuitive interactions with 3D objects. Five groups participated in our competition, submitting a total of 114 runs. While the results obtained in our competition are satisfactory, we note that the challenges presented by this task are far from fully solved. As such, we provide insights into potential areas for future research and improvements. We believe we can help push the boundaries of 3D object retrieval and facilitate more user-friendly interactions via vision-language technologies.},

  abstract={The retrieval of 3D objects has gained significant importance in recent years due to its broad range of applications in computer vision, computer graphics, virtual reality, and augmented reality. However, the retrieval of 3D objects presents significant challenges due to the intricate nature of 3D models, which can vary in shape, size, and texture, and have numerous polygons and vertices. To this end, we introduce a novel SHREC challenge track that focuses on retrieving relevant 3D animal models from a dataset using sketch queries and expedites accessing 3D models through available sketches. Furthermore, a new dataset named ANIMAR was constructed in this study, comprising a collection of 711 unique 3D animal models and 140 corresponding sketch queries. Our contest requires participants to retrieve 3D models based on complex and detailed sketches. We receive satisfactory results from eight teams and 204 runs. Although further improvement is necessary, the proposed task has the potential to incentivize additional research in the domain of 3D object retrieval, potentially yielding benefits for a wide range of applications. We also provide insights into potential areas of future research, such as improving techniques for feature extraction and matching and creating more diverse datasets to evaluate retrieval performance.},

  title={Knowledge Distillation for Lumbar Spine X-ray Classification},
  author={Nguyen, Minh-Khang and Huynh, Viet-Tham and Vo, Thi Thuy-Giang and Tran, Minh-Triet},
  abstract={Lumbar spondylosis is a prevalent chronic illness that results in deformation of the lumbar spine and limits human movement. Over time, spinal deformities can compress or exert tension on the nerve roots, resulting in lower back discomfort and disc herniation. The incidence of spondylosis is escalating, attributed to a growing population of younger individuals. This tendency results from alterations like contemporary jobs and education. X-ray imaging of the lumbar spine is widely utilized and endorsed by several physicians for its rapidity, precision, and accessibility across diverse patient populations. This article introduces a technique for detecting and classifying both abnormal and healthy lumbar spine X-ray pictures. After image filtration, we implement Knowledge Distillation, wherein a trained teacher model instructs smaller student models. We employ EfficientNet-B4 as the Teacher model, a high-accuracy and efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for medical image analysis, and MobileNetV2 as the Student model, which also utilizes the knowledge distillation approach. To assess the model's performance, 2,000 lumbar spine X-ray pictures were obtained from Kien Giang General Hospital and Trung Cang General Clinic, with 872 samples designated for training and testing. The outcomes attained an accuracy of 91.0%, a precision of 90.0%, a recall of 91.8%, and an F1-score of 90.9%. The findings were achieved after 500 training epochs with a learning rate 0.001. This indicates that our suggested model has strong performance with excellent dependability.},
