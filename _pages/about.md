I am currently a Researcher at the University of Science - VNUHCM, Vietnam. In this role, I focus on advancing cutting-edge technologies and contributing to various innovative projects in the field of computer science.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate and master's programs at the University of Science - VNUHCM under the supervision of [Prof. Minh-Triet Tran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lt2ATkkAAAAJ) and [Prof. Tam Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qIaGn7YAAAAJ). Their mentorship was invaluable in shaping my academic journey and deepening my understanding of complex scientific concepts.

My primary research focus is on Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). Additionally, I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and actively explore its potential applications in AR and VR to enhance user experiences. My goal is to leverage AI to create more immersive and interactive virtual environments.
